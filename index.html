          <p>You might see how the Cracker moves, even in its subtle ways. The
             Cracker struggles, toils, moves with and against the way. It <em>pulses</em>
             in order to find value.</p>
          <p>And where does one find such value? Only the Cracker knows and sees
             all. There is no mystery here, no magic or witchcarft. This is
             the work of science at its finest. There is nothing wrong with the
             way you look at this, but simply the lack of that matters. After all,
             perception is consciousness.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In the beginneing there was nothing. Then there was this <em>thing</em>, a
            <strong>Cracker</strong> whiling silently in space. It created worlds and saw the very start of life take place.
            It saw all, it knew all and was <strong>inevitable</strong>. </p>
          <p>However, the Cracker was not a just an inanimate object. It sought
            power, life and the only way to do that was by taking the life of
            other entities.

      <p>Perhaps it started off as a joke, or maybe a mechanical input of some
         sort and has a predetermined function, but one thing is for sure, it
         <em>grows</em>. It is curious, it seeks, it learns and from that we can presume
         that its environment is built to resist it, else it wouldn't exist.</p>
